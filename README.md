# StationSnap

StationSnap is a mobile-first restaurant SOP, training, qualification, and checklist application.

## Repository status

Phases 0 through 2 are complete. The repository now includes the project foundation plus secure manager and employee authentication, separate expiring sessions, role/location authorization, password recovery, employee PIN access, rate limiting, lockouts, and audit history.

Approved visual designs are still required before visual fidelity can be evaluated; see `docs/design-component-map.md` for the provisional functional mapping.

## Add source materials

- Put product requirements and coding plans in `product/`.
- Put approved design source files, exports, and screenshots in `design/`.
- Put technical assessment and implementation planning documents in `docs/`.
- Do not commit passwords, API keys, database credentials, employee PINs, or production data.

## Phase 0 documents

- `docs/implementation-plan.md`
- `docs/route-map.md`
- `docs/data-model.md`
- `docs/design-component-map.md`
- `docs/testing-plan.md`

## Local environment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the example PostgreSQL credentials.
2. Set a development-only `SEED_MANAGER_PASSWORD` of at least 12 characters and a four-digit `SEED_EMPLOYEE_PIN`. These values are hashed before storage and seeds are rejected in production.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Apply the schema with `npm run db:migrate`.
5. Load the idempotent demo data with `npm run db:seed`.
6. Start the application with `npm run dev`.

Manager password reset requires all `SMTP_*` settings. The application uses generic reset responses, single-use 30-minute tokens, and revokes existing manager sessions after a successful reset.

The demo employee access codes are `stationsnap-demo` and either `downtown` or `riverside`. Manager emails and employee numbers are defined in `src/server/db/seed-data.ts`; their secrets come only from the local seed environment.

`npm run db:verify` starts a temporary PostgreSQL instance, migrates it from empty, loads demo data, verifies record counts, and then removes the temporary database. Run `npm run verify` for formatting, linting, strict type checks, tests, and a production build.

The health endpoints are `/health` and `/api/health`. They return `503` without exposing connection details when PostgreSQL is unavailable.
